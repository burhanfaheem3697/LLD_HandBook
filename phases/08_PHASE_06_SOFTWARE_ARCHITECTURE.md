- Labs: modular monolith first, then justify service boundaries using quality attributes.
- Diagrams: C4 context/container/component, dependency diagrams, deployment sketch.

## Assessment

Produce an ADR-backed architecture packet for Food Delivery with explicit trade-offs, quality attributes, module boundaries, and testing strategy.


## Guided Self-Study Program

This section upgrades the phase from syllabus to workbook. It does not change phase order, module order, lesson order, project order, dependencies, outcomes, or philosophy. It expands each existing lesson into a concrete self-study plan.

### Phase Study Rhythm

- Study one lesson at a time.
- Do not begin the next lesson until the checklist for the current lesson is complete.
- Keep one Git repository for the phase and one folder per lesson.
- Commit after each day with a message that names the lesson ID.
- Maintain a learning-journal.md with definitions, mistakes, diagrams, and senior-engineering observations.

### P06.M01.L01 Guided Study: Layered architecture

#### Lesson Overview

- Learning objectives: explain Layered architecture precisely; implement it in Java; identify where it improves design; critique when it is unnecessary; connect it to software architecture.
- Prerequisites: all prior phases and the phase prerequisites listed above.
- Knowledge dependency graph: $(@{Id=P06.M01.L01; Title=Layered architecture}.Id) depends on $depends; unlocks $unlocks; future applications include framework internals, production design reviews, and open-source reading.
- Estimated duration: 4 study days, 8-12 focused hours.
- Difficulty: L3-L4.
- Expected outcomes: I can define the concept, implement a small Java example, test it, diagram it, explain trade-offs, and teach it to another engineer.

#### Step 1 - Video First

- Primary lecture: use 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md, Video Track P06, selecting the lecture whose topic is closest to "Layered architecture".
- Required metadata to record in notes: title, instructor, channel, URL, duration, watch speed, timestamps, topics, reason for recommendation, and assumed prior knowledge.
- Watch speed recommendation: 1.0x for first exposure; 1.25x only during revision.
- Timestamps deserving extra attention: opening problem framing, first worked example, first design trade-off, and final summary. Pause and reimplement the example whenever code appears.
- Reason for recommendation: the track prioritizes MIT, Stanford, CMU, university material, official conference talks, and official framework talks over casual videos.

#### Step 2 - Book Reading

- Best book track: Software Architecture in Practice, 4th ed.; Clean Architecture; Building Evolutionary Architectures.
- Chapters and sections: use the chapter mapping in 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md for Phase 6; choose the row matching "Layered architecture".
- Exact pages: pin to the edition you own; record the page range in your margin notes before starting.
- Pages safe to skip: Skip historical sidebars, language-specific comparisons outside Java, and exercises unrelated to software architecture until quarterly revision.
- Reading objective: extract definitions, invariants, examples, and design forces, not just terminology.
- Estimated reading time: 90-150 minutes.
- Important diagrams: copy any object, sequence, architecture, lifecycle, or state diagram by hand and annotate the dependency direction.
- Definitions to memorize: the central term, its preconditions, its failure mode, and one alternative.
- Examples to reimplement: translate the book example into Java using the package handbook.phase06.lessonp06m01l01.
- Margin notes: mark "why invented", "trade-off", "misuse", "testing consequence", and "open-source sighting".
- Exercises to solve: solve at least three end-of-chapter or self-created exercises: one recall, one implementation, one design critique.

#### Step 3 - Technical Blogs and Primary References

- Martin Fowler or ThoughtWorks: read the relevant article when the lesson touches architecture, refactoring, patterns, enterprise design, microservices, or evolutionary design; write why the article changes how you would design Java code.
- InfoQ or official engineering blog: read one production case study to see operational constraints and team trade-offs.
- Official documentation: read the matching Java, Spring, Hibernate, Kafka, Netty, Tomcat, Redis, Jackson, Guava, JUnit, Mockito, or OkHttp documentation when the concept appears in that ecosystem.
- RFC or research paper: use only when the lesson involves protocols, distributed systems, concurrency, event logs, or consensus; summarize the problem statement and the assumptions.
- Do not dump links into notes. For each reference, write: "I am reading this because..." and "This changes my design by...".

#### Step 4 - Hands-on Implementation

1. Implement the smallest Java example that demonstrates "Layered architecture".
2. Refactor the example once to improve naming, cohesion, and testability.
3. Extend the example with one realistic variation point.
4. Debug one intentionally broken version and document the failure.
5. Benchmark or profile only when the lesson has runtime implications; otherwise perform a code review against the lesson's design forces.

#### Step 5 - UML Exercise

- Draw one class or package diagram to show static structure.
- Draw one sequence diagram to show runtime collaboration.
- Draw an activity or state diagram if the lesson includes workflow, lifecycle, protocol, transaction, or concurrency behavior.
- Why: diagrams force you to separate structure from behavior and reveal hidden dependencies that code can obscure.

#### Step 6 - Machine Coding

Build a small Java exercise named after $(@{Id=P06.M01.L01; Title=Layered architecture}.Id):

- Input: a tiny but realistic scenario involving "Layered architecture".
- Output: working code, tests, README note, and one diagram.
- Constraint: no framework magic unless the lesson is explicitly about frameworks.
- Minimum tests: happy path, invalid input, boundary condition, and one design-regression test.

#### Step 7 - Daily Study Plan

Day 1:
- Watch the primary lecture from the phase video track.
- Take handwritten notes using the headings: problem, vocabulary, example, trade-off, misuse.
- Read the first assigned book section.
- Reimplement the simplest example exactly once.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 2:
- Finish the assigned reading.
- Reimplement the example without looking.
- Write unit tests before adding the extension.
- Draw the static UML diagram.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 3:
- Complete the hands-on implementation and machine coding exercise.
- Debug one broken variant.
- Draw the sequence diagram.
- Answer the mini quiz and write a short design note.
- Time: 3 hours.
Day 4:
- Read one technical blog, official doc, RFC, or paper from the lesson reference list.
- Connect the concept to Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways.
- Refactor the implementation and update tests.
- Time: 2-3 hours.
#### Step 8 - Lab

- Problem statement: design and implement a Java component where "Layered architecture" is necessary to keep behavior understandable and changeable.
- Requirements: clear public API, enforced invariants, automated tests, meaningful package names, and one diagram.
- Constraints: keep the solution small; prefer explicit Java over framework shortcuts; document every design trade-off.
- Starter structure:

`	ext
src/main/java/handbook/phase06/p06m01l01/
src/test/java/handbook/phase06/p06m01l01/
docs/P06.M01.L01-diagram.md
`

- Acceptance criteria: code compiles, tests pass, README explains the concept, diagrams match code, and a reviewer can identify the main design decision in under five minutes.
- Extensions: add one new requirement without breaking existing tests.
- Stretch goals: add property-style tests, benchmark results, or a second implementation using a different trade-off.
- Evaluation rubric: correctness 30%, design clarity 25%, tests 20%, documentation 15%, trade-off explanation 10%.

#### Step 9 - Module Project Connection

At the end of this module, fold the lesson artifact into the module project:

- Functional requirement: the project must use the lesson concept in one visible feature.
- Non-functional requirement: preserve readability, testability, and explicit failure behavior.
- Suggested folder structure: keep production code under src/main/java, tests under src/test/java, diagrams under docs/diagrams, and ADRs under docs/adr.
- Milestones: model first, tests second, implementation third, review fourth.
- Deliverables: code, tests, README, UML/Mermaid diagram, and one ADR.
- Testing requirements: unit tests plus one integration-style test when collaboration crosses a boundary.
- Documentation requirements: explain purpose, usage, alternatives, and limitations.
- GitHub README expectations: problem statement, how to run, design decisions, test command, and known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: feature behavior 30%, design fit 30%, test confidence 20%, documentation 20%.

#### Step 10 - Revision Plan

- Daily revision: restate the concept from memory and run the tests.
- Weekly revision: compare your solution against one alternative and update the diagram.
- Monthly revision: revisit the open-source connection and identify the same idea in real code.
- Quarterly revision: rebuild the exercise from scratch with stricter constraints.
- Spiral revision: when this concept reappears in a later phase, add a note explaining what your earlier understanding missed.

#### Step 11 - Common Mistakes

- Beginner mistakes: memorizing the term without implementing it; writing code before naming responsibilities; skipping tests.
- Intermediate mistakes: over-abstracting; hiding simple behavior behind unnecessary interfaces; drawing diagrams that do not match code.
- Professional mistakes: optimizing for current convenience while damaging API stability, operability, or future migration.
- Senior engineers avoid these by stating forces, constraints, alternatives, and failure modes before committing to a design.

#### Step 12 - Design Thinking

- Why invented: to solve a recurring problem in software architecture where naive code becomes hard to change, test, or reason about.
- What came before: ad hoc procedural logic, duplicated conditionals, informal conventions, or tightly coupled modules.
- Alternatives: simpler direct code, different object model, framework-provided mechanism, data-driven design, or architectural boundary.
- When not to use: when the problem has no real variation, no public API pressure, or no meaningful lifecycle/behavioral complexity.
- Performance implications: identify allocation, dispatch, synchronization, I/O, or serialization costs if present.
- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

#### Step 13 - Open Source Connection

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

- Package or class name.
- Entry point.
- Key interface.
- Extension point.
- Control flow.
- One class to ignore initially.
- One reimplementation task in your own words.

- Alternatives: simpler direct code, different object model, framework-provided mechanism, data-driven design, or architectural boundary.
- When not to use: when the problem has no real variation, no public API pressure, or no meaningful lifecycle/behavioral complexity.
- Performance implications: identify allocation, dispatch, synchronization, I/O, or serialization costs if present.
- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

#### Step 13 - Open Source Connection

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

- Package or class name.
- Entry point.
- Key interface.
- Extension point.
- Control flow.
- One class to ignore initially.
- One reimplementation task in your own words.

### P06.M02.L01 Guided Study: Modular monoliths

#### Lesson Overview

- Learning objectives: explain Modular monoliths precisely; implement it in Java; identify where it improves design; critique when it is unnecessary; connect it to software architecture.
- Prerequisites: the previous lesson in this module and all phase-level prerequisites.
- Knowledge dependency graph: $(@{Id=P06.M02.L01; Title=Modular monoliths}.Id) depends on $depends; unlocks $unlocks; future applications include framework internals, production design reviews, and open-source reading.
- Estimated duration: 4 study days, 8-12 focused hours.
- Difficulty: L3-L4.
- Expected outcomes: I can define the concept, implement a small Java example, test it, diagram it, explain trade-offs, and teach it to another engineer.

#### Step 1 - Video First

- Primary lecture: use 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md, Video Track P06, selecting the lecture whose topic is closest to "Modular monoliths".
- Required metadata to record in notes: title, instructor, channel, URL, duration, watch speed, timestamps, topics, reason for recommendation, and assumed prior knowledge.
- Watch speed recommendation: 1.0x for first exposure; 1.25x only during revision.
- Timestamps deserving extra attention: opening problem framing, first worked example, first design trade-off, and final summary. Pause and reimplement the example whenever code appears.
- Reason for recommendation: the track prioritizes MIT, Stanford, CMU, university material, official conference talks, and official framework talks over casual videos.

#### Step 2 - Book Reading

- Best book track: Software Architecture in Practice, 4th ed.; Clean Architecture; Building Evolutionary Architectures.
- Chapters and sections: use the chapter mapping in 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md for Phase 6; choose the row matching "Modular monoliths".
- Exact pages: pin to the edition you own; record the page range in your margin notes before starting.
- Pages safe to skip: Skip historical sidebars, language-specific comparisons outside Java, and exercises unrelated to software architecture until quarterly revision.
- Reading objective: extract definitions, invariants, examples, and design forces, not just terminology.
- Estimated reading time: 90-150 minutes.
- Important diagrams: copy any object, sequence, architecture, lifecycle, or state diagram by hand and annotate the dependency direction.
- Definitions to memorize: the central term, its preconditions, its failure mode, and one alternative.
- Examples to reimplement: translate the book example into Java using the package handbook.phase06.lessonp06m02l01.
- Margin notes: mark "why invented", "trade-off", "misuse", "testing consequence", and "open-source sighting".
- Exercises to solve: solve at least three end-of-chapter or self-created exercises: one recall, one implementation, one design critique.

#### Step 3 - Technical Blogs and Primary References

- Martin Fowler or ThoughtWorks: read the relevant article when the lesson touches architecture, refactoring, patterns, enterprise design, microservices, or evolutionary design; write why the article changes how you would design Java code.
- InfoQ or official engineering blog: read one production case study to see operational constraints and team trade-offs.
- Official documentation: read the matching Java, Spring, Hibernate, Kafka, Netty, Tomcat, Redis, Jackson, Guava, JUnit, Mockito, or OkHttp documentation when the concept appears in that ecosystem.
- RFC or research paper: use only when the lesson involves protocols, distributed systems, concurrency, event logs, or consensus; summarize the problem statement and the assumptions.
- Do not dump links into notes. For each reference, write: "I am reading this because..." and "This changes my design by...".

#### Step 4 - Hands-on Implementation

1. Implement the smallest Java example that demonstrates "Modular monoliths".
2. Refactor the example once to improve naming, cohesion, and testability.
3. Extend the example with one realistic variation point.
4. Debug one intentionally broken version and document the failure.
5. Benchmark or profile only when the lesson has runtime implications; otherwise perform a code review against the lesson's design forces.

#### Step 5 - UML Exercise

- Draw one class or package diagram to show static structure.
- Draw one sequence diagram to show runtime collaboration.
- Draw an activity or state diagram if the lesson includes workflow, lifecycle, protocol, transaction, or concurrency behavior.
- Why: diagrams force you to separate structure from behavior and reveal hidden dependencies that code can obscure.

#### Step 6 - Machine Coding

Build a small Java exercise named after $(@{Id=P06.M02.L01; Title=Modular monoliths}.Id):

- Input: a tiny but realistic scenario involving "Modular monoliths".
- Output: working code, tests, README note, and one diagram.
- Constraint: no framework magic unless the lesson is explicitly about frameworks.
- Minimum tests: happy path, invalid input, boundary condition, and one design-regression test.

#### Step 7 - Daily Study Plan

Day 1:
- Watch the primary lecture from the phase video track.
- Take handwritten notes using the headings: problem, vocabulary, example, trade-off, misuse.
- Read the first assigned book section.
- Reimplement the simplest example exactly once.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 2:
- Finish the assigned reading.
- Reimplement the example without looking.
- Write unit tests before adding the extension.
- Draw the static UML diagram.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 3:
- Complete the hands-on implementation and machine coding exercise.
- Debug one broken variant.
- Draw the sequence diagram.
- Answer the mini quiz and write a short design note.
- Time: 3 hours.
Day 4:
- Read one technical blog, official doc, RFC, or paper from the lesson reference list.
- Connect the concept to Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways.
- Refactor the implementation and update tests.
- Time: 2-3 hours.
#### Step 8 - Lab

- Problem statement: design and implement a Java component where "Modular monoliths" is necessary to keep behavior understandable and changeable.
- Requirements: clear public API, enforced invariants, automated tests, meaningful package names, and one diagram.
- Constraints: keep the solution small; prefer explicit Java over framework shortcuts; document every design trade-off.
- Starter structure:

`	ext
src/main/java/handbook/phase06/p06m02l01/
src/test/java/handbook/phase06/p06m02l01/
docs/P06.M02.L01-diagram.md
`

- Acceptance criteria: code compiles, tests pass, README explains the concept, diagrams match code, and a reviewer can identify the main design decision in under five minutes.
- Extensions: add one new requirement without breaking existing tests.
- Stretch goals: add property-style tests, benchmark results, or a second implementation using a different trade-off.
- Evaluation rubric: correctness 30%, design clarity 25%, tests 20%, documentation 15%, trade-off explanation 10%.

#### Step 9 - Module Project Connection

At the end of this module, fold the lesson artifact into the module project:

- Functional requirement: the project must use the lesson concept in one visible feature.
- Non-functional requirement: preserve readability, testability, and explicit failure behavior.
- Suggested folder structure: keep production code under src/main/java, tests under src/test/java, diagrams under docs/diagrams, and ADRs under docs/adr.
- Milestones: model first, tests second, implementation third, review fourth.
- Deliverables: code, tests, README, UML/Mermaid diagram, and one ADR.
- Testing requirements: unit tests plus one integration-style test when collaboration crosses a boundary.
- Documentation requirements: explain purpose, usage, alternatives, and limitations.
- GitHub README expectations: problem statement, how to run, design decisions, test command, and known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: feature behavior 30%, design fit 30%, test confidence 20%, documentation 20%.

#### Step 10 - Revision Plan

- Daily revision: restate the concept from memory and run the tests.
- Weekly revision: compare your solution against one alternative and update the diagram.
- Monthly revision: revisit the open-source connection and identify the same idea in real code.
- Quarterly revision: rebuild the exercise from scratch with stricter constraints.
- Spiral revision: when this concept reappears in a later phase, add a note explaining what your earlier understanding missed.

#### Step 11 - Common Mistakes

- Beginner mistakes: memorizing the term without implementing it; writing code before naming responsibilities; skipping tests.
- Intermediate mistakes: over-abstracting; hiding simple behavior behind unnecessary interfaces; drawing diagrams that do not match code.
- Professional mistakes: optimizing for current convenience while damaging API stability, operability, or future migration.
- Senior engineers avoid these by stating forces, constraints, alternatives, and failure modes before committing to a design.

#### Step 12 - Design Thinking

- Why invented: to solve a recurring problem in software architecture where naive code becomes hard to change, test, or reason about.
- What came before: ad hoc procedural logic, duplicated conditionals, informal conventions, or tightly coupled modules.

- When not to use: when the problem has no real variation, no public API pressure, or no meaningful lifecycle/behavioral complexity.
- Performance implications: identify allocation, dispatch, synchronization, I/O, or serialization costs if present.
- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

#### Step 13 - Open Source Connection

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

- Package or class name.
- Entry point.
- Key interface.
- Extension point.
- Control flow.
- One class to ignore initially.
- One reimplementation task in your own words.

### Module 06.02 Project

- Scope: integrate the module lessons: Modular monoliths; Microservices; API gateway and backend-for-frontend.
- Functional requirements: expose one complete user-facing or developer-facing workflow that proves the three concepts work together.
- Non-functional requirements: readable Java API, deterministic tests, clear errors, simple package structure, and documented limitations.
- Suggested folder structure:

`	ext
module-project/
  README.md
  docs/architecture.md
  docs/adr/0001-design.md
  docs/diagrams/module-flow.md
  src/main/java/
  src/test/java/
`

- Milestones: requirements note; object model; first test; implementation; refactor; diagram; review.
- Deliverables: source code, tests, README, architecture note, UML/Mermaid diagrams, and one design review checklist.
- Testing requirements: unit tests for each concept, collaboration tests across concepts, and one regression test for a likely mistake.
- Documentation requirements: explain how the module project uses software architecture and where it deliberately avoids over-engineering.
- GitHub README expectations: problem, run commands, design overview, trade-offs, test command, known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: concept integration 35%, correctness 25%, test quality 20%, clarity of design explanation 20%.

### P06.M03.L01 Guided Study: Microkernel and plugin architecture

#### Lesson Overview

- Learning objectives: explain Microkernel and plugin architecture precisely; implement it in Java; identify where it improves design; critique when it is unnecessary; connect it to software architecture.
- Prerequisites: the previous lesson in this module and all phase-level prerequisites.
- Knowledge dependency graph: $(@{Id=P06.M03.L01; Title=Microkernel and plugin architecture}.Id) depends on $depends; unlocks $unlocks; future applications include framework internals, production design reviews, and open-source reading.
- Estimated duration: 4 study days, 8-12 focused hours.
- Difficulty: L3-L4.
- Expected outcomes: I can define the concept, implement a small Java example, test it, diagram it, explain trade-offs, and teach it to another engineer.

#### Step 1 - Video First

- Primary lecture: use 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md, Video Track P06, selecting the lecture whose topic is closest to "Microkernel and plugin architecture".
- Required metadata to record in notes: title, instructor, channel, URL, duration, watch speed, timestamps, topics, reason for recommendation, and assumed prior knowledge.
- Watch speed recommendation: 1.0x for first exposure; 1.25x only during revision.
- Timestamps deserving extra attention: opening problem framing, first worked example, first design trade-off, and final summary. Pause and reimplement the example whenever code appears.
- Reason for recommendation: the track prioritizes MIT, Stanford, CMU, university material, official conference talks, and official framework talks over casual videos.

#### Step 2 - Book Reading

- Best book track: Software Architecture in Practice, 4th ed.; Clean Architecture; Building Evolutionary Architectures.
- Chapters and sections: use the chapter mapping in 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md for Phase 6; choose the row matching "Microkernel and plugin architecture".
- Exact pages: pin to the edition you own; record the page range in your margin notes before starting.
- Pages safe to skip: Skip historical sidebars, language-specific comparisons outside Java, and exercises unrelated to software architecture until quarterly revision.
- Reading objective: extract definitions, invariants, examples, and design forces, not just terminology.
- Estimated reading time: 90-150 minutes.
- Important diagrams: copy any object, sequence, architecture, lifecycle, or state diagram by hand and annotate the dependency direction.
- Definitions to memorize: the central term, its preconditions, its failure mode, and one alternative.
- Examples to reimplement: translate the book example into Java using the package handbook.phase06.lessonp06m03l01.
- Margin notes: mark "why invented", "trade-off", "misuse", "testing consequence", and "open-source sighting".
- Exercises to solve: solve at least three end-of-chapter or self-created exercises: one recall, one implementation, one design critique.

#### Step 3 - Technical Blogs and Primary References

- Martin Fowler or ThoughtWorks: read the relevant article when the lesson touches architecture, refactoring, patterns, enterprise design, microservices, or evolutionary design; write why the article changes how you would design Java code.
- InfoQ or official engineering blog: read one production case study to see operational constraints and team trade-offs.
- Official documentation: read the matching Java, Spring, Hibernate, Kafka, Netty, Tomcat, Redis, Jackson, Guava, JUnit, Mockito, or OkHttp documentation when the concept appears in that ecosystem.
- RFC or research paper: use only when the lesson involves protocols, distributed systems, concurrency, event logs, or consensus; summarize the problem statement and the assumptions.
- Do not dump links into notes. For each reference, write: "I am reading this because..." and "This changes my design by...".

#### Step 4 - Hands-on Implementation

1. Implement the smallest Java example that demonstrates "Microkernel and plugin architecture".
2. Refactor the example once to improve naming, cohesion, and testability.
3. Extend the example with one realistic variation point.
4. Debug one intentionally broken version and document the failure.
5. Benchmark or profile only when the lesson has runtime implications; otherwise perform a code review against the lesson's design forces.

#### Step 5 - UML Exercise

- Draw one class or package diagram to show static structure.
- Draw one sequence diagram to show runtime collaboration.
- Draw an activity or state diagram if the lesson includes workflow, lifecycle, protocol, transaction, or concurrency behavior.
- Why: diagrams force you to separate structure from behavior and reveal hidden dependencies that code can obscure.

#### Step 6 - Machine Coding

Build a small Java exercise named after $(@{Id=P06.M03.L01; Title=Microkernel and plugin architecture}.Id):

- Input: a tiny but realistic scenario involving "Microkernel and plugin architecture".
- Output: working code, tests, README note, and one diagram.
- Constraint: no framework magic unless the lesson is explicitly about frameworks.
- Minimum tests: happy path, invalid input, boundary condition, and one design-regression test.

#### Step 7 - Daily Study Plan

Day 1:
- Watch the primary lecture from the phase video track.
- Take handwritten notes using the headings: problem, vocabulary, example, trade-off, misuse.
- Read the first assigned book section.
- Reimplement the simplest example exactly once.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 2:
- Finish the assigned reading.
- Reimplement the example without looking.
- Write unit tests before adding the extension.
- Draw the static UML diagram.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 3:
- Complete the hands-on implementation and machine coding exercise.
- Debug one broken variant.
- Draw the sequence diagram.
- Answer the mini quiz and write a short design note.
- Time: 3 hours.
Day 4:
- Read one technical blog, official doc, RFC, or paper from the lesson reference list.
- Connect the concept to Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways.
- Refactor the implementation and update tests.
- Time: 2-3 hours.
#### Step 8 - Lab

- Problem statement: design and implement a Java component where "Microkernel and plugin architecture" is necessary to keep behavior understandable and changeable.
- Requirements: clear public API, enforced invariants, automated tests, meaningful package names, and one diagram.
- Constraints: keep the solution small; prefer explicit Java over framework shortcuts; document every design trade-off.
- Starter structure:

`	ext
src/main/java/handbook/phase06/p06m03l01/
src/test/java/handbook/phase06/p06m03l01/
docs/P06.M03.L01-diagram.md
`

- Acceptance criteria: code compiles, tests pass, README explains the concept, diagrams match code, and a reviewer can identify the main design decision in under five minutes.
- Extensions: add one new requirement without breaking existing tests.
- Stretch goals: add property-style tests, benchmark results, or a second implementation using a different trade-off.
- Evaluation rubric: correctness 30%, design clarity 25%, tests 20%, documentation 15%, trade-off explanation 10%.

#### Step 9 - Module Project Connection

At the end of this module, fold the lesson artifact into the module project:

- Functional requirement: the project must use the lesson concept in one visible feature.
- Non-functional requirement: preserve readability, testability, and explicit failure behavior.
- Suggested folder structure: keep production code under src/main/java, tests under src/test/java, diagrams under docs/diagrams, and ADRs under docs/adr.
- Milestones: model first, tests second, implementation third, review fourth.
- Deliverables: code, tests, README, UML/Mermaid diagram, and one ADR.
- Testing requirements: unit tests plus one integration-style test when collaboration crosses a boundary.
- Documentation requirements: explain purpose, usage, alternatives, and limitations.
- GitHub README expectations: problem statement, how to run, design decisions, test command, and known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: feature behavior 30%, design fit 30%, test confidence 20%, documentation 20%.

#### Step 10 - Revision Plan

- Daily revision: restate the concept from memory and run the tests.
- Weekly revision: compare your solution against one alternative and update the diagram.
- Monthly revision: revisit the open-source connection and identify the same idea in real code.
- Quarterly revision: rebuild the exercise from scratch with stricter constraints.
- Spiral revision: when this concept reappears in a later phase, add a note explaining what your earlier understanding missed.

#### Step 11 - Common Mistakes

- Beginner mistakes: memorizing the term without implementing it; writing code before naming responsibilities; skipping tests.
- Intermediate mistakes: over-abstracting; hiding simple behavior behind unnecessary interfaces; drawing diagrams that do not match code.
- Professional mistakes: optimizing for current convenience while damaging API stability, operability, or future migration.
- Senior engineers avoid these by stating forces, constraints, alternatives, and failure modes before committing to a design.

#### Step 12 - Design Thinking

- Why invented: to solve a recurring problem in software architecture where naive code becomes hard to change, test, or reason about.
- What came before: ad hoc procedural logic, duplicated conditionals, informal conventions, or tightly coupled modules.
- Alternatives: simpler direct code, different object model, framework-provided mechanism, data-driven design, or architectural boundary.
- When not to use: when the problem has no real variation, no public API pressure, or no meaningful lifecycle/behavioral complexity.
- Performance implications: identify allocation, dispatch, synchronization, I/O, or serialization costs if present.
- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

#### Step 13 - Open Source Connection

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

- Package or class name.
- Entry point.
- Key interface.
- Extension point.
- Control flow.
- One class to ignore initially.
- One reimplementation task in your own words.

### Module 06.03 Project

- Scope: integrate the module lessons: Microkernel and plugin architecture; Pipe and filter; Workflow and rule engines.
- Functional requirements: expose one complete user-facing or developer-facing workflow that proves the three concepts work together.
- Non-functional requirements: readable Java API, deterministic tests, clear errors, simple package structure, and documented limitations.
- Suggested folder structure:

`	ext
module-project/
  README.md
  docs/architecture.md
  docs/adr/0001-design.md
  docs/diagrams/module-flow.md
  src/main/java/
  src/test/java/
`

- Milestones: requirements note; object model; first test; implementation; refactor; diagram; review.
- Deliverables: source code, tests, README, architecture note, UML/Mermaid diagrams, and one design review checklist.
- Testing requirements: unit tests for each concept, collaboration tests across concepts, and one regression test for a likely mistake.
- Documentation requirements: explain how the module project uses software architecture and where it deliberately avoids over-engineering.
- GitHub README expectations: problem, run commands, design overview, trade-offs, test command, known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: concept integration 35%, correctness 25%, test quality 20%, clarity of design explanation 20%.

### P06.M04.L01 Guided Study: ADRs and architecture reviews

#### Lesson Overview

- Learning objectives: explain ADRs and architecture reviews precisely; implement it in Java; identify where it improves design; critique when it is unnecessary; connect it to software architecture.
- Prerequisites: the previous lesson in this module and all phase-level prerequisites.
- Knowledge dependency graph: $(@{Id=P06.M04.L01; Title=ADRs and architecture reviews}.Id) depends on $depends; unlocks $unlocks; future applications include framework internals, production design reviews, and open-source reading.
- Estimated duration: 4 study days, 8-12 focused hours.
- Difficulty: L3-L4.
- Expected outcomes: I can define the concept, implement a small Java example, test it, diagram it, explain trade-offs, and teach it to another engineer.

#### Step 1 - Video First

- Primary lecture: use 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md, Video Track P06, selecting the lecture whose topic is closest to "ADRs and architecture reviews".
- Required metadata to record in notes: title, instructor, channel, URL, duration, watch speed, timestamps, topics, reason for recommendation, and assumed prior knowledge.
- Watch speed recommendation: 1.0x for first exposure; 1.25x only during revision.
- Timestamps deserving extra attention: opening problem framing, first worked example, first design trade-off, and final summary. Pause and reimplement the example whenever code appears.
- Reason for recommendation: the track prioritizes MIT, Stanford, CMU, university material, official conference talks, and official framework talks over casual videos.

#### Step 2 - Book Reading

- Best book track: Software Architecture in Practice, 4th ed.; Clean Architecture; Building Evolutionary Architectures.
- Chapters and sections: use the chapter mapping in 22_RESOURCE_CATALOG.md for Phase 6; choose the row matching "ADRs and architecture reviews".
- Exact pages: pin to the edition you own; record the page range in your margin notes before starting.
- Pages safe to skip: Skip historical sidebars, language-specific comparisons outside Java, and exercises unrelated to software architecture until quarterly revision.
- Reading objective: extract definitions, invariants, examples, and design forces, not just terminology.
- Estimated reading time: 90-150 minutes.
- Important diagrams: copy any object, sequence, architecture, lifecycle, or state diagram by hand and annotate the dependency direction.
- Definitions to memorize: the central term, its preconditions, its failure mode, and one alternative.
- Examples to reimplement: translate the book example into Java using the package handbook.phase06.lessonp06m04l01.
- Margin notes: mark "why invented", "trade-off", "misuse", "testing consequence", and "open-source sighting".
- Exercises to solve: solve at least three end-of-chapter or self-created exercises: one recall, one implementation, one design critique.

#### Step 3 - Technical Blogs and Primary References

- Martin Fowler or ThoughtWorks: read the relevant article when the lesson touches architecture, refactoring, patterns, enterprise design, microservices, or evolutionary design; write why the article changes how you would design Java code.
- InfoQ or official engineering blog: read one production case study to see operational constraints and team trade-offs.
- Official documentation: read the matching Java, Spring, Hibernate, Kafka, Netty, Tomcat, Redis, Jackson, Guava, JUnit, Mockito, or OkHttp documentation when the concept appears in that ecosystem.
- RFC or research paper: use only when the lesson involves protocols, distributed systems, concurrency, event logs, or consensus; summarize the problem statement and the assumptions.
- Do not dump links into notes. For each reference, write: "I am reading this because..." and "This changes my design by...".

#### Step 4 - Hands-on Implementation

1. Implement the smallest Java example that demonstrates "ADRs and architecture reviews".
2. Refactor the example once to improve naming, cohesion, and testability.
3. Extend the example with one realistic variation point.
4. Debug one intentionally broken version and document the failure.
5. Benchmark or profile only when the lesson has runtime implications; otherwise perform a code review against the lesson's design forces.

#### Step 5 - UML Exercise

- Draw one class or package diagram to show static structure.
- Draw one sequence diagram to show runtime collaboration.
- Draw an activity or state diagram if the lesson includes workflow, lifecycle, protocol, transaction, or concurrency behavior.
- Why: diagrams force you to separate structure from behavior and reveal hidden dependencies that code can obscure.

#### Step 6 - Machine Coding

Build a small Java exercise named after $(@{Id=P06.M04.L01; Title=ADRs and architecture reviews}.Id):

- Input: a tiny but realistic scenario involving "ADRs and architecture reviews".
- Output: working code, tests, README note, and one diagram.
- Constraint: no framework magic unless the lesson is explicitly about frameworks.
- Minimum tests: happy path, invalid input, boundary condition, and one design-regression test.

#### Step 7 - Daily Study Plan

Day 1:
- Watch the primary lecture from the phase video track.
- Take handwritten notes using the headings: problem, vocabulary, example, trade-off, misuse.
- Read the first assigned book section.
- Reimplement the simplest example exactly once.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 2:
- Finish the assigned reading.
- Reimplement the example without looking.
- Write unit tests before adding the extension.
- Draw the static UML diagram.
- Time: 3 hours.

Day 3:
- Complete the hands-on implementation and machine coding exercise.
- Debug one broken variant.
- Draw the sequence diagram.
- Answer the mini quiz and write a short design note.
- Time: 3 hours.
Day 4:
- Read one technical blog, official doc, RFC, or paper from the lesson reference list.
- Connect the concept to Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways.
- Refactor the implementation and update tests.
- Time: 2-3 hours.
#### Step 8 - Lab

- Problem statement: design and implement a Java component where "ADRs and architecture reviews" is necessary to keep behavior understandable and changeable.
- Requirements: clear public API, enforced invariants, automated tests, meaningful package names, and one diagram.
- Constraints: keep the solution small; prefer explicit Java over framework shortcuts; document every design trade-off.
- Starter structure:

`	ext
src/main/java/handbook/phase06/p06m04l01/
src/test/java/handbook/phase06/p06m04l01/
docs/P06.M04.L01-diagram.md
`

- Acceptance criteria: code compiles, tests pass, README explains the concept, diagrams match code, and a reviewer can identify the main design decision in under five minutes.
- Extensions: add one new requirement without breaking existing tests.
- Stretch goals: add property-style tests, benchmark results, or a second implementation using a different trade-off.
- Evaluation rubric: correctness 30%, design clarity 25%, tests 20%, documentation 15%, trade-off explanation 10%.

#### Step 9 - Module Project Connection

At the end of this module, fold the lesson artifact into the module project:

- Functional requirement: the project must use the lesson concept in one visible feature.
- Non-functional requirement: preserve readability, testability, and explicit failure behavior.
- Suggested folder structure: keep production code under src/main/java, tests under src/test/java, diagrams under docs/diagrams, and ADRs under docs/adr.
- Milestones: model first, tests second, implementation third, review fourth.
- Deliverables: code, tests, README, UML/Mermaid diagram, and one ADR.
- Testing requirements: unit tests plus one integration-style test when collaboration crosses a boundary.
- Documentation requirements: explain purpose, usage, alternatives, and limitations.
- GitHub README expectations: problem statement, how to run, design decisions, test command, and known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: feature behavior 30%, design fit 30%, test confidence 20%, documentation 20%.

#### Step 10 - Revision Plan

- Daily revision: restate the concept from memory and run the tests.
- Weekly revision: compare your solution against one alternative and update the diagram.
- Monthly revision: revisit the open-source connection and identify the same idea in real code.
- Quarterly revision: rebuild the exercise from scratch with stricter constraints.
- Spiral revision: when this concept reappears in a later phase, add a note explaining what your earlier understanding missed.

#### Step 11 - Common Mistakes

- Beginner mistakes: memorizing the term without implementing it; writing code before naming responsibilities; skipping tests.
- Intermediate mistakes: over-abstracting; hiding simple behavior behind unnecessary interfaces; drawing diagrams that do not match code.
- Professional mistakes: optimizing for current convenience while damaging API stability, operability, or future migration.
- Senior engineers avoid these by stating forces, constraints, alternatives, and failure modes before committing to a design.

#### Step 12 - Design Thinking

- Why invented: to solve a recurring problem in software architecture where naive code becomes hard to change, test, or reason about.
- What came before: ad hoc procedural logic, duplicated conditionals, informal conventions, or tightly coupled modules.
- Alternatives: simpler direct code, different object model, framework-provided mechanism, data-driven design, or architectural boundary.
- When not to use: when the problem has no real variation, no public API pressure, or no meaningful lifecycle/behavioral complexity.
- Performance implications: identify allocation, dispatch, synchronization, I/O, or serialization costs if present.
- Maintainability implications: improves changeability only when names, boundaries, and tests remain clear.
- Testability implications: should make behavior easier to isolate; if tests become harder, revisit the abstraction.

#### Step 13 - Open Source Connection

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

Look for the concept in Spring Boot, Tomcat, Kafka, Redis, and API gateways. Record:

- Package or class name.
- Entry point.
- Key interface.
- Extension point.
- Control flow.
- One class to ignore initially.
- One reimplementation task in your own words.

#### Step 14 - Checklist

- [ ] I watched the assigned lecture and captured timestamped notes.
- [ ] I read the assigned book sections and recorded page ranges.
- [ ] I implemented the core example in Java.
- [ ] I solved at least three exercises.
- [ ] I drew the required UML/Mermaid diagrams.
- [ ] I tested happy path, failure path, and boundary behavior.
- [ ] I reviewed mistakes and refactored once.
- [ ] I can explain why this concept exists and when not to use it.
- [ ] I can teach this concept to another engineer.

### Module 06.04 Project

- Scope: integrate the module lessons: ADRs and architecture reviews; Fitness functions; Project: Food Delivery architecture.
- Functional requirements: expose one complete user-facing or developer-facing workflow that proves the three concepts work together.
- Non-functional requirements: readable Java API, deterministic tests, clear errors, simple package structure, and documented limitations.
- Suggested folder structure:

`	ext
module-project/
  README.md
  docs/architecture.md
  docs/adr/0001-design.md
  docs/diagrams/module-flow.md
  src/main/java/
  src/test/java/
`

- Milestones: requirements note; object model; first test; implementation; refactor; diagram; review.
- Deliverables: source code, tests, README, architecture note, UML/Mermaid diagrams, and one design review checklist.
- Testing requirements: unit tests for each concept, collaboration tests across concepts, and one regression test for a likely mistake.
- Documentation requirements: explain how the module project uses software architecture and where it deliberately avoids over-engineering.
- GitHub README expectations: problem, run commands, design overview, trade-offs, test command, known limitations.
- Evaluation rubric: concept integration 35%, correctness 25%, test quality 20%, clarity of design explanation 20%.
